Start with education. A typical sub-Saharan pupil spends six years in school but retains only three years’ worth of learning, Wolfgang Lutz of the Wittgenstein Centre in Vienna estimated in 2015. A typical Japanese student spends 14 years in classes and absorbs 16 years’ worth of education. Using a different methodology, the World Bank also finds that education is spectacularly worse in poor countries than in rich ones (see chart 2).
Tonee Ndungu, an entrepreneur in Kenya, thinks AI could help bridge this gap. He has developed two apps that he hopes to launch this year. One, called Somanasi (“Learn with me”), is for children. It allows pupils to ask a talking chatbot questions related to the Kenyan school curriculum. The Economist asked, “How do I work out a percentage from a fraction?” The chatbot offered a step-by-step worked example.
A chatbot can give undivided attention to each child, at any time of day, and never gets tired (so long as your phone is charged). It can also be adapted to local cultures. “I never saw an apple till I was 30,” says Mr Ndungu. “So we say ‘A is for animal.’” The service can be tailored to different learning styles, too. It might illustrate division by telling children to break a pencil in half and then again. Depending on how different pupils respond, the AI can figure out whether this approach works, and fine-tune the way it interacts with them. Some kids want more numbers some like stories. The chatbot adapts.
It cannot yet mark homework. But Mr Ndungu’s firm, Kytabu, offers an app for teachers, too, called Hodari (“Brave”). It lightens their workload by crafting step-by-step lesson plans. It helps track what pupils understand, by getting each one to answer questions on a smartphone. (One phone per classroom is enough, he says.)
As far as The Economist could tell from playing with them in a café with good Wi-Fi, the two apps work well. But the proof will come—and bugs will be fixed—when more people use them in classrooms and homes. They will be given away to begin with. Mr Ndungu hopes eventually to charge for add-ons. The more children are enrolled, the cheaper it will be to provide the service. If half a million were to join, Mr Ndungu predicts the cost per child would fall from $3.50 a month (not including the phone) to about 15 cents.
Many entrepreneurs are pursuing similar projects, often using open-source models developed in rich countries, sometimes with help from charities like the Gates Foundation. The cost of getting AI to learn new languages appears low. It is already being used to write children’s books in tongues previously too obscure for commercial publishers to bother with.
The need is glaring. Developing countries have too few teachers, many of whom have not mastered the curriculum. A study in 2015 (using data going back to 2007) found that four-fifths of grade six maths teachers in South Africa did not understand the concepts they were supposed to teach. Nearly 90% of ten-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa cannot read a simple text.
