# UniversalDispatchR

This repository stores the input and output files of my R-based set of functions to generate pedagogical material (i.e. slides, worksheets and Moodle exercises).

"worksheet.pdf", "worksheet-corrected.pdf" and "lesson.pdf" were created from the `.csv` files in the main folder.

"MOODLE-EXERCISES.xml" was created using the `.csv` files in the `data/` folder.

The interactive exercises can be tried on my website and its Moodle:
