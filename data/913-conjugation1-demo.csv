The movement;began;on September 16th,
when Mahsa Amini, whom Iran’s morality police;had arrested;for wearing her headscarf “improperly”,
;died;in their custody.
Beyond their remarkable bravery, little;is known;for certain about the protesters

Police;opened;fire
and;killed;97 “marchers and rioters”.
Since then, the share of protests recorded as deadly;has fallen;from 22% to 5%.
